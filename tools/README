mv desktop_approots.tgz /etc/
tar -xzvf desktop_approots.tgz
cd desktop_approots
sh integrate_all_apps.sh

logout and login back again. Click on the Application Manager (third icon from the right end of the panel). Now you can populate the panel's submenus
with apps by dragging them from the Application Manager to the "Install Icon" entry on the subpanels.

If you do not want all my app groups you can de-integrate them. Say you do not want the XXXX group. Do as root:

cd /etc/desktop_approots/XXXX/
sh deintegrateXXXX.sh

logout and login.
